# Classification of Breast Cancer Images

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the classification of breast cancer images using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores key stages of the process, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, aiming to build an accurate and reliable classification system.

## Features

- Step-by-step workflow for image classification.
- Use of machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer images.
- Detailed explanations for preprocessing, training, and evaluation stages.
- Visualizations and metrics to assess model performance.

## Structure of the Notebook

- **Title**: Classification of Breast Cancer Images
- **Total Cells**: 48
  - Markdown Cells: Provide theoretical explanations and context.
  - Code Cells: Contain Python code for data loading, processing, and modeling.
